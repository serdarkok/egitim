> This app created by Nuxt.js. 

I used:

websocket
mongodb - mongoose
element-ui
cookie-universal-nuxt

You can create quiz of event, question, user. If you started any event, it will have created auto sub url.

> For example: www.domain.com/254fe

![login screen](https://i.hizliresim.com/odD6Do.png)

Clients enter to that url, system want to some information then client waits any question. All client took same question, client can answer the question.


## Build Setup

$ npm run install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:3000
